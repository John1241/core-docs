# Docker on .NET Framework

In this section you'll learn the techniques needed to run your existing .NET Framework applications in Windows Containers using Docker. The following tutorials are available:

1. [Running Console applications in Docker](console.md)
2. [Running ASP.NET MVC applications in Docker](aspnetmvc.md)

You can learn more about Windows Containers, including what they are and the requirements for running them, on the [Windows Containers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/about_overview) and [Getting Started with Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) articles. 

In this section you'll learn techniques to run your existing .NET
applications using Docker images running in Windows servers.

You can begin by [moving a console application to Docker](console.md).
If you are more interested in an ASP.NET MVC application, try the
